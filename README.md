# Would you rather Project

This is my own implementation of the "Would you rather..." game as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree.

In this app, you will be able to choose your user from a preset list of users (which emulates a sign in process), and will access a private area where you will be able to:

- Check and answer all your unanswered questions, among all existing questions;
- Check all your answered questions, among all existing questions;
- Check the stats of a specific question;
- Create new questions;
- Check the leaderboard.

## Installation

Clone this repo and, inside the cloned rep, run:

    $ npm install

## Laching

After installation, run:

    $ npm start

If not automatically loaded, open your browser and acess http://localhost:3000
